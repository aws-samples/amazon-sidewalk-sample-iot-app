    Merge pull request #8304 from kyleknap/fix-line-lengths-v1
    
    Extend docutils line length limit

commit 9b3b86c58eadb96023698f84f86fefc01b70c171
Author: kyleknap <kyknapp1@gmail.com>

    Extend docutils line length limit
    
    This is a temporary fix to handle JSON snippets in the man pages
    that are longer than the default docutils line limit of 10,000
    and cause the man pages for some EC2 examples to not render.
    
    Long term, we should consider breaking up the enums to multiple
    lines or potentially not enumerate all enums in the JSON snippets.
    
    The value 50,000 was chosen based on the line length for
    InstanceType enums for the ec2 create-launch-template-version
    command. Currently, the line length for the InstanceType enums
    is just over 10,000. Assuming each enum is 10 characters long,
    a line length of 50,000 would give us the runway for roughly
    4000 more instance types. The line length was not made magnitudes
    higher (i.e. to avoid hitting this issue ever again) because
    lines of this length are already not ideal and we should make sure
    to implement a more long term solution.
